# PPO vs SAC: Comparative Analysis for Energy Optimization with Country-Level Insights

This repository provides the implementation and comparative evaluation of two popular Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms — Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC). The focus of the study is on energy optimization tasks, including algorithmic performance analysis (stability, speed, efficiency) and regional energy consumption comparisons (Balkan vs Nordic countries).

The project was designed as part of PhD research on energy-efficient computing and sustainable AI frameworks.

## Project Highlights

- Implementation of PPO and SAC agents using Stable Baselines 3.
- Performance evaluation based on:
  - Action variance (stability indicator)
  - Execution speed (episodes per second)
  - Average action scores
- Regional energy consumption analysis:
  - Balkan vs Nordic countries
  - Renewable energy share, fossil fuel dependence, oil consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, electricity generation, solar energy trends
- Publication-ready figures in PDF format (for Overleaf/LaTeX integration).
- Prepared for Q1 journal submission (aligned with academic standards).
